{"name":"Linux Package Installer for Wordpress","tagline":"A module for LPI which automatically installs Wordpress, easily and securely. Optionally, add-ons can also be installed automatically","body":"###Linux Package Installer for Wordpress (LPI-WP) \r\n\r\nBlog Post: https://www.buckhill.co.uk/blog/how-to-automatically-install-wordpress-plus-plugins/6\r\n\r\nLPI-WP installs and auto configures Wordpress, with by default, **ssh-sftp-updater**, **w3-total-cache** and **Wordfence security** modules.  Additional default modules can be specified.\r\n\r\nLPI-WP is primarily designed to work with Web Chroot Manager (WCM) (https://github.com/Buckhill/web-chroot-manager), but with extra parameters provided it can function independently on any generic LAMP installation.\r\n\r\n#### Limitations\r\n\r\nLPI-WP has been designed for Ubuntu 12.04+ LTS.  Debian is not yet officially support but should work. CentOS/Redhat support are due with the next release.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed MySQL is listening on 127.0.0.1:3306, although this can be changed by editing the DB_SERVER variable within the shell file.\r\n\r\n#### Installation requirements\r\n\r\nThe domain which will be configured using LPI-WP must be resolvable by the server, either via DNS or hosts file\r\n\r\n#### How to use LPI-WP\r\n\r\nThere are two modes, WCM mode (default) and generic mode\r\n\r\nWCM can be found here: https://github.com/Buckhill/web-chroot-manager\r\n\r\nUsage: ./linux-package-installer-for-wordpress.sh [options...]\r\n\r\n#### WCM mode\r\n\r\nLPI-WP relies on WCM configuration files. This mode is default, only two options are required:\r\n\r\n- -u (Secondary Username)\r\n- -s (Domain Name)\r\n\r\nAfter Wordpress has successfully installed the script outputs the credentials for the WP admin user\r\n\r\n**Optional arguments:**\r\n\r\n- -c path to WCM config dir. /etc/buckhill-wcm is default\r\n\r\n#### Generic mode\r\n\r\nCan be ran on any LAMP installation, WCM is not required.  It is assumed the MySQL server is running locally\r\n\r\n**Certain parameters are mandatory:**\r\n\r\n- -g enables generic mode\r\n- -w web user. The user under PHP scripts are ran. On Ubuntu this is 'www-data'\r\n- -d full path of a directory where Wordpress will be installed\r\n- -u User which will be the owner of the Wordpress files. Can be the same as web user, but not recommended. Can be root.\r\n- -e email address. Needed for Wordpress installation, otherwise final configuration will fail\r\n- -s the domain name, must be resolvable locally or via DNS\r\n\r\n**Optional arguments:**\r\n\r\n- -m Database name. LPI-WP will by default automatically generate the DB name and DB user from the username and site name given.  This can be overwritten by using this option\r\n- -y Answer \"y\" to all questions\r\n- -t path to temporary folder where Wordpress and modules are downloaded. Default is /tmp/wp_install\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Generic mode example command\r\n\r\n$ ./linux-package-installer-for-wordpress.sh -g -w www-data -d /var/www/yourdomain.com/public -u www-data -e youremail@yourdomain.com -s yourdomain.com -m databasename\r\n","google":"UA-46210494-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
